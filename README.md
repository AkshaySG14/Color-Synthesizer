# Color-Synthesizer
Colorsynthesizer is a mac application that allows the user to interact with a "pixel board". By coloring pixels on the board, the 
user can create a variety of colorful patterns, of any shape or size. The application allows the user to change 
the cursor size, to erase or fill the pixel board, and to create nearly any color through three color sliders.

The application itself was created in Xcode, and written in C++ as a learning experience. Though written completely in C++, the code is built on the SFML framework, which provided the functions necessary for the code to work. Regardless, anyone versed in C++ would be able to easily examine the code.

To launch the application, a mac with the
latest OS is required. The application itself can be launched immediately once downloaded. Due to the simplicity of the application, it only requires a mouse/trackpad. The user should be able to easily 
navigate through the UI to interact with the application.
